## The Micro-Trader Application


## Micro-Trader Dashboard

The quote generator simulates the evolution of the values of 3 companies. Every quote is sent on the event bus. It also exposes a Http endpoint to retrieve the last quote of each company.


### Task - Deploying the dashboard

We also need to deploy the dashboard. In the browser, let's enter the associated Ingress route: http://micro-trader-dashboard-reactive-microservices.sidartasilva.io. By appending "/admin", we should see the dashboard in the Vert.x Console.

If we go to the Trader tab, the graph should display the evolution of the market.
